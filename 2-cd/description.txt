The objective of this lab is to become familiar with convolutional neural networks, that are very suitable
to deal with images. To do so, we will study the classical layers of this type of network and we will set up a
first network trained on the standard CIFAR-10 dataset. Once the first network is tested, we will discuss
different techniques to improve the network learning process : normalization, data augmentation, variants of
SGD, dropout and batch normalization.
