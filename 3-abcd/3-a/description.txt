The goal of this TP is to become acquainted with a well-known and commonly-used deep CNN network:
VGG16 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015). Then, the method described by Chatfield et al. (2014) will be used
with this network on the 15 Scene dataset. We will particularly look at the strategy to extract deep features
thanks to a pre-trained network, and we will use these features in a classic classification scheme using linear
SVM.
