GANs:

The aim of this last section of the Project Work was to study GANs, which focuses not on the
classification of images but on their recreation.
To do this, the Generative Adversarial Networks make use of two neural networks: the Generator, which
generates images from a random distribution of noise trying to replicate a particular distribution and
the Discriminator, another neural network whose aim is to distinguish real images from those generated
by the Generator.
By optimizing both networks we are able to produce false images that are indistinguishable from the
source set.
