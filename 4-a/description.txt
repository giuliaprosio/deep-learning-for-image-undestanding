The aspect we will focus on now is the necessity for the image classificators to be robust - specifically
to have a reliable uncertainty estimation in the decision (classification) process.
The goal of this project work and the next ones is to focus and deepen our knowledge regarding the
robustness analysis in Deep Learning.
With practical work 4a we use and analyze to use of the Bayesian models in uncertainty estimation -
both linear regression and non-linear models, such as the Polynomial and Gaussian.
