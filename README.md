# Deep learning for image understanding 
Folder with a sequence of standalone 
projects to study ML/DL techniques to 
analyze images. 
The work is based on the Deep Learning
course followed at Sorbonne Universit√© during the academic year 2022/2023. 

## Structure
Each folder contains a description of the theories behind the project and the results obtained, along to the google colab notebook. 


## Project 1 - Image Descriptor and Classification
Here my paper analyzing the work on this first projct: [go to paper HW-1](./1-Image-Descriptors-Classification/HW1.pdf)

The first project is focused on the study and understanding of how images are coded and classified when using ML/DL techniques. 
The most widely used descriptors are SIFT and the BoW
techniques. SIFT is a feature extraction method invariant 
to scale and orientation of picture, so that different 
angles and scales depicting the same 
figure are classified within the same class. 
The Bag of Words technique allows us to summarize the 
local SIFT descriptors of an image into a global descriptor, 
with the help of a visual dictionary.

## Project 2 - Neural Networks and Convolutional NN
Here my paper analyzing the work on this second projct: [go to paper HW-2](./2-CNN/HW2.pdf). 

In this projects we explore Neural Networks and Convolutional 
Neural Networks. 
In order to appreciate their work, we initially 
manually calculate the steps followed by the NN, 
and then gradually introduce PyTorch libraries.
